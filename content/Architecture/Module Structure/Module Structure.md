In our Flutter development environment, each module follows a standardized structure to promote consistency and maintainability. The structure of each module comprises three main components:


1. **<module_name>_module.dart** : The outer layer of the module serves as a dependency injection hub where all dependencies within the module are declared. This file ensures proper dependency management and facilitates modularization. Additionally, it acts as the exporter of the module, making its functionalities accessible to other parts of the application.

2. **<module_name>.dart**: This file acts as the entry point and primary interface for the module. It provides a high-level overview of the module's functionalities and serves as a bridge between the module and the rest of the application.

3. **src folder**: The src folder houses the remaining code of the module, including the implementation of features, UI components, business logic, and utilities. Organizing the code within the src folder helps maintain a clean directory structure and separates implementation details from the module's interface. its organized into tree distinct layers :
	- [[Presentation]]
	- [[Domain Layer]]
	- [[Data Layer]]

**Example Module Structure** :

Let's take the auth module as an example:

```
packages/auth/lib/
├── auth.dart
├── auth_module.dart
└── src
    ├── api
    │   └── api_interceptor.dart
    ├── data
    │   ├── auth_data.dart
    │   ├── datasources
    │   ├── mappers
    │   ├── model
    │   ├── models
    │   └── repositories
    ├── domain
    │   ├── domain.dart
    │   ├── entities
    │   ├── enums
    │   ├── repositories
    │   └── usecases
    └── presentation
        ├── cubits
        ├── pages
        ├── presentation.dart
        └── widgets

```
