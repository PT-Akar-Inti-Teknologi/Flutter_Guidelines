The domain layer houses the business contracts for the module, encompassing repositories, entities, and use cases.  

* UseCase represents specific functionalities or discrete actions that users or systems can perform within the application. It acts as a bridge between state management (Presentation layer) and Repository (Data layer). In cases where API integration is pending, mocking or bypassing data can occur within this layer. 

* Entity denotes a data class utilized across domain and presentation layers. If an Entity is used as a parameter, it should be suffixed with Param (e.g., LoginParam). Entities are created using Freeze, with all fields being required if possible. 

* Repositories possess distinct threads where two files are dedicated to them: one for the interface and one for the implementation. The domain layer houses the interface, solely consisting of the business contract of the repository. Its implementation is in the Data layer. 

This structure promotes loose coupling, separation of concerns, and adherence to principles like Single Responsibility and Dependency Inversion, ensuring modularity, testability, and flexibility in managing data storage and retrieval.
